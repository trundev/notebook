> The notebooks in the [master](../../tree/master) branch of this repository may not include the output from the Python cells, like plots.
> The goal is to commit the actual _source_ changes only, but not the generated result, i.e. images, tables, etc.
>
> Visit the [generated](../../tree/generated) branch to get the final view. This branch is auto-generated by the GitHub actions
> [workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml#L62-L70) by executing the Python cells in all notebooks.


Work in progress _(with "generated" output on nbviewer.org)_:

- [RLC circuit model](https://nbviewer.org/github/trundev/notebook/tree/generated/rlc_circuit.ipynb) ([original](rlc_circuit.ipynb)) - Model of resistor-inductor-capacitor electronic circuit

- [RLC calculator](https://nbviewer.org/github/trundev/notebook/tree/generated/rlc_calc.ipynb) ([original](rlc_calc.ipynb)) - Example calculation
of RLC circuit parameters and initial conditions, at the startup and after a shock-change in some of the component values
