# Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebook playground.

> The notebooks in the [master](../../tree/master) branch of this repository may not include the output from the Python cells, like plots.
> The goal is to commit the actual _source_ changes only, but not the generated result, i.e. images, tables, etc.
>
> Visit the [generated](../../tree/generated) branch to get the final view. This branch is auto-generated by the GitHub actions
> [workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml#L56-L64) by executing the Python cells in all notebooks.


Work in progress _(with "generated" output on nbviewer.org)_:
